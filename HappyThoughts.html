    Umm, so 6 months huh. Idk what to type here (yet!).

      Aahhh. That was what I initially typed in here. Well I really would like
      to write you a long love letter, but for now - a bit of backstory. Nothing
      much, it's just that I wanted to make this since the beginning of
      vacation. I wanted this to be our 6 month's present , but uhh, work, the
      shitty PG where I couldn't do anything properly and all that happened. But
      yes, then I became lazy, but still tried putting in whatever I could do
      at, each point of time. And today, well, got a bit motivated, and decided
      to push this website into test region (Fancy slang - What I am trying to
      say that I am just getting started on this, this is still a work in
      progress and as and when I learn stuff. I will add into this.) But ummm,
      yeah... I know it looks a lot trash, a lot to learn, but .... I don't know
      what I am trying to say. But I do know this. That I love you. So much. So
      so much. I love you a lot, a lot a lot. Ummwahhhh!!!
